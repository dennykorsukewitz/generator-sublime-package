Description:
    Creates a Default.sublime-mousemap file.
    The mousemap files (which have the extension .sublime-mousemap) control what commands are executed when a user performs an action with a mouse, e.g. clicking a mouse button, scrolling the scroll wheel, etc.

Example:
    yo sublime-package:mousemap

    This will create:
        mousemaps/Default.sublime-mousemap:                  *.sublime-mousemap files contain a JSON array that contains JSON objects to specify the key bindings.
